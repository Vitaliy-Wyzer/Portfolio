# Brain Stroke Data Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of brain stroke cases and explores various factors that might influence the occurrence of strokes, such as age, glucose levels, smoking status, and more.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

## Key Insights
- Most stroke cases occurred in people who never smoked or formerly smoked.
- The likelihood of having a stroke increases with age, especially after 40.
- No significant relationship was found between stroke occurrence and residence type.
- Glucose levels show a correlation with stroke occurrence, with higher levels linked to more cases.
- Self-employed individuals had the highest stroke percentage, though more data would be needed for a conclusive analysis.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Install necessary libraries: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy`
3. Run the main analysis script: `python brain_stroke_analysis.py`
